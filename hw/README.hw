The hardware for the probe is a simple Arduino (I used a Leonardo clone)
with a DHT11 wired up with the data/comms pin to Arduino pin 2.

Arudino pin 3 is used to check the status of a related door, but could be
used for any switch you need to monitor.  This pin should be pulled low by 
the switch.

The sketch in src/ needs the libraries in libraries/.  You can install the 
copies from here, or you can pull them down yourself into your Arduino IDE -
either works.
